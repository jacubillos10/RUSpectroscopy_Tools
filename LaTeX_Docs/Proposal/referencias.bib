abstract = {Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) involves the study of the mechanical resonances of solids. The resonant response of a particular object depends on its shape, elastic constants, crystallographic orientation, density, and dissipation. It is possible to obtain the complete elastic constant matrix of relatively low-symmetry materials from a RUS spectrum on a single small sample . The measurement and the computation of the RUS spectra of solids are reviewed. Several examples of the use of the technique are discussed.}

abstract = {The mechanical resonant response of a solid depends on its shape, density, elastic moduli and dissipation. We describe here instrumentation and computational methods for acquiring and analyzing the resonant ultrasound spectrum of very small (0.001 cm3) samples as a function of temperature, and provide examples to demonstrate the power of the technique. The information acquired is in some cases comparable to that obtained from other more conventional ultrasonic measurement techniques, but one unique feature of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is that all moduli are determined simultaneously to very high accuracy. Thus in circumstances where high relative or absolute accuracy is required for very small crystalline or other anisotropic samples RUS can provide unique information. RUS is also sensitive to the fundamental symmetry of the object under test so that certain symmetry breaking effects are uniquely observable, and because transducers require neither couplant nor a flat surface, broken fragments of a material can be quickly screened for phase transitions and other temperature-dependent responses.}

    abstract = "{The Rayleigh‐Ritz method of eigenvalue approximation is used to obtain a solution for the free vibrations of an elastic solid. The resonant frequencies of an isotropic cube, calculated by this method, agree with the frequencies of the Lamé modes, for which an exact solution is possible, up to eight significant digits. Experimental measurements of the 13 lowest‐frequency modes of a cube of fused quartz are all within 0.5\\% of the results computed by using the elastic constants determined by another method. These constants differ from the elastic constants determined directly from the experimental frequencies by less than 0.2\\% for the shear modulus and by less than 0.003 for the value of Poisson's ratio. The cube‐resonance method of elastic constant determination is also applicable to substances of more general crystallographic symmetry.}",
