abstract = {Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) involves the study of the mechanical resonances of solids. The resonant response of a particular object depends on its shape, elastic constants, crystallographic orientation, density, and dissipation. It is possible to obtain the complete elastic constant matrix of relatively low-symmetry materials from a RUS spectrum on a single small sample . The measurement and the computation of the RUS spectra of solids are reviewed. Several examples of the use of the technique are discussed.}

abstract = {The mechanical resonant response of a solid depends on its shape, density, elastic moduli and dissipation. We describe here instrumentation and computational methods for acquiring and analyzing the resonant ultrasound spectrum of very small (0.001 cm3) samples as a function of temperature, and provide examples to demonstrate the power of the technique. The information acquired is in some cases comparable to that obtained from other more conventional ultrasonic measurement techniques, but one unique feature of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is that all moduli are determined simultaneously to very high accuracy. Thus in circumstances where high relative or absolute accuracy is required for very small crystalline or other anisotropic samples RUS can provide unique information. RUS is also sensitive to the fundamental symmetry of the object under test so that certain symmetry breaking effects are uniquely observable, and because transducers require neither couplant nor a flat surface, broken fragments of a material can be quickly screened for phase transitions and other temperature-dependent responses.}

abstract={We used deep-learning-based models to automatically obtain elastic moduli from resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) spectra, which conventionally require user intervention of published analysis codes. By strategically converting theoretical RUS spectra into their modulated fingerprints and using them as a dataset to train neural network models, we obtained models that successfully predicted both elastic moduli from theoretical test spectra of an isotropic material and from a measured steel RUS spectrum with up to 9.6{\%} missing resonances. We further trained modulated fingerprint-based models to resolve RUS spectra from yttrium--aluminum-garnet (YAG) ceramic samples with three elastic moduli. The resulting models were capable of retrieving all three elastic moduli from spectra with a maximum of 26{\%} missing frequencies. In summary, our modulated fingerprint method is an efficient tool to transform raw spectroscopy data and train neural network models with high accuracy and resistance to spectra distortion.},

    abstract = "{Device fabrication based on piezoelectric materials requires prior characterization of full matrix constants. For this, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard on piezoelectricity suggests the use of ultrasonic pulse-echo and electric resonance methods. However, these techniques tend to provide inconsistent characterization, because they require multiple samples with drastically different sizes. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a promising alternative, because it uses only a single sample for characterization, thus ensuring self-consistent results. The inverse problem of finding material constants from resonant frequencies is often solved using the nonlinear least squares method despite its being a time-consuming algorithm. Herein, deep learning (DL) is introduced in the inversion procedure of RUS. After the DL network is trained, the material constants are determined with high efficiency. The practicability and reliability of the combination of DL and RUS are demonstrated by characterizing the full tensor constants of LiNbO3 single crystals.}",

abstract = {Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and machine learning are used to rule out many theories of hidden order in URu2Si2. The unusual correlated state that emerges in URu2Si2 below THO = 17.5 K is known as “hidden order” because even basic characteristics of the order parameter, such as its dimensionality (whether it has one component or two), are “hidden.” We use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the symmetry-resolved elastic anomalies across THO. We observe no anomalies in the shear elastic moduli, providing strong thermodynamic evidence for a one-component order parameter. We develop a machine learning framework that reaches this conclusion directly from the raw data, even in a crystal that is too small for traditional resonant ultrasound. Our result rules out a broad class of theories of hidden order based on two-component order parameters, and constrains the nature of the fluctuations from which unconventional superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. Our machine learning framework is a powerful new tool for classifying the ubiquitous competing orders in correlated electron systems. }}
